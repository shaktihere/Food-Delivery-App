# Welcome to the world of React

# Food App

Here we build our app, first we made a raw sketch about the app overall structure. There after using functional component we build each layer i.e. header, body, footer. In body we used props and mapping of array. We used real data from Swiggy official site for learning purpose that how real data works.
