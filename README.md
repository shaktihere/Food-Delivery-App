# Welcome to the world of React

# Food App

Here we built our app, first, we made a raw sketch of the app's overall structure. Thereafter using functional component we build each layer i.e. header, body, and footer. In the body, we used props and mapping of the array. We used real data from Swiggy's official site for learning purposes that how real data works.
